# A bolierplate for react & redux, extending the create-react-app starter
Tech Used

Creating from starter [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

Influenced heavily by [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) without features such as internalisation and component async loading.

Added following tech to kickstart.

1. React-Router
2. Immutable.JS https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/
3. Styled components https://www.styled-components.com/
4. Enzyme (Testing tools) https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme
5. Plop.JS (Templating) https://plopjs.com/

To generate componenet run 'npm run generate' and follow instructions

TODO - Add Thunk or Sagas for async api loading
